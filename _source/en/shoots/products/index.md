## Show Your Products

Product shots are about putting passion into the hands of the observer. When the client gets the product, we also want those expectations to be correct. That is why taking photos of products is especially centered around getting the form, the texture and the color right. We may also want to put the product in a favorable environment.

## Product Shots on a Plexglass Table

The Plexiglass table allows for a finer control of lighting. For example, we can block light from hitting the product directly, or have the light hit the product head-on. Most product shots are taken with a tilt-shift lens and powerful flashes allowing for more sharpness.

## Computer-Friendly Product Shooting

We take care to make sure the product shots are compatible with your publication medium : paper or electronic.
