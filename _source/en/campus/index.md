SeeShoot, Chris Mann photography and IT is part of the 4e Œil Photo Studio in the Grands Voisins colony in an abandoned hospital spanning 4 hectometers in the heart of Paris right across the street for the Observatoire. It really kicks butt!

The 4th Œil Photo Studio is a collective of four photographers -- Christopher, Davide, Jérémie et Marine -- sharing an operating and an anesthesia room in the Garden of Pierre Petit in the Grands Voisins complex at the old Saint-Vincent-de-Paul Hospital complex. Our goal is client satisfaction through quality and constant photographic exploration. Come and visit us at our studio 82, ave Denfert Rochereau 75014 PARIS! :)

## Garden of Pierre Petit

This is our micro-community in the Grands Voisins full of artists, craftspeople, non-profits and businesses in the operating complex accessible by the Garden entrance. 

## [Les Grands Voisins](http://www.lesgrandsvoisins.org)

Les Grands Voisins is the repurposed Saint-Vincent-de-Paul Hospital for 650 residents, 450 workers for 150 structures. This is a colony of artists, craftspeople, non-profits, businesses and residents in a place that is full of events, artistic works, music and in-general good vibes. It also is a microcosme for what society could be. This is a wonderful place for you to have your picture taken.
